# Pandas-Challenge

Combining Python & Pandas to execute an analysis on gaming data. More specifically, analyses pertained to the in-game purchases of the players. One interesting finding was that while the male demographic makes up the majority of players (84.03%), on average, female players spend slightly more than their male counterparts. Female players average spending $3.20, while men average at $3.02. For the total average per person the number goes up to $4.47 for females compared to $4.07 for males.
